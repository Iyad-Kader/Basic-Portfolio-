  <p>My name is Iyad Kader and I was born in Sacramento, CA. I moved to Orange County at the start of seventh grade. Ever since I moved, I was always interested in software development. Especilly being around my cousin who is a full stack developer. I am currently taking a course at UCI Division of Continuing education to learn full stack development. I have six siblings. Two sisters and three brothers. I also have two neices and a nephew. I plan on doing many things with software especially in business with my family.
